The popular board game where a player must guess the colors and ordering of four colored pegs chosen by an adversary. The player is given 12 guesses total, and recieves feedback on each guess.

For example, if the solution is [red, red, blue green] and the player guessed [red, blue,purple,green], The player would get the feedback : [hit,close,miss,hit].

Feedback explanation

hit indicates that the color guessed for that peg is correct and in the correct location
close indicates that the color guessed is in the solution but is in a different location
miss indicates that the color guessed is not in the solution
